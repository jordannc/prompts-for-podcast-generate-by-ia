| capa | 3.1>> two small robots, a microphone between them and a little bit taller. The first robot, in the right side, is made out of corroded tin and cogs, have one eye bigger than the other and looks funny, the second robot in the left side is made out of cans and metal scraps and its also corroded but looks bland. The background is a scrapyard in a cloudy day. Low-poly 3d, game, 4k|
OBS: O MidJourney não estava disponível, então optei por usar o site "Freepik" para a geração da capa.
